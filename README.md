mfc-node-recorder
=================
I've been using the MFC Recorder for a long time and changed it a bit, because I wanted to make it easier and better. 
If I made a mistake in the steps, say freely, so we'll correct it because I did not do something similar before.
mfc-node lets you follow and record your favorite models' shows on myfreecams.com
This is an attempt to create a script similar to [capturbate-node](https://github.com/SN4T14/capturebate-node) 
and [mfc-node](https://github.com/sstativa/mfc-node) based on different pieces of code found on the Internet.

Requirements
============
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/) used to run mfc-node, hence the name. (Tested on `6.9.4` and `6.10.2`)
[ffmpeg] must be a last version somewere in the path.
This produce a high quality flv file who not need conversion, so that part is removed from the script.

Setup
=====
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/) (tested with `6.9.4` and `6.10.2`).
2. Download and unpack the [code](https://github.com/horacio/mfc-node-recorder/archive/master.zip).
3. Open console and go into the directory where you unpacked the files.
4. Install requirements by running `npm install` in the same directory as `mfc.js` is.
5. Edit `config.yml` file and set desirable values for `captureDirectory`, `modelScanInterval` and `dateFormat`.
6. Install [ffmpeg]. For Windows users, copy `ffmpeg.exe` into same directory as `main.js` or somewhere in the path ('C:\Windows\' for example)

Running
===========
1. Open console and go into the directory where you unpacked the files.
2. Run `node main.js`.
3. Open http://localhost:9080 in your browser. 
The list of online models will be displayed with a set of allowed commands for each model:
	* __Include__ - if you want to record the model
	* __Exclude__ - if you don't want to record the model anymore
	* __Delete__ - if you are not interested in the model and wanna hide her permanently

> Note: This is not a real-time application. Whenever your __include__, __exclude__ or __delete__ the model your changes will be 
  applied only with the next iteration of `mainLoop` function of the script. `mainLoop` runs every 30 seconds (default value for 
  `modelScanInterval`).

> Note: There is no __auto reload__ feature, you have to reload the list manually (__big red button__), however, keep in mind the 
  script updates the list internally every 30 seconds (`modelScanInterval`), therefore sometimes you'll have to wait 30 seconds to 
  see your updates.

> Note: Be mindful when capturing many streams at once to have plenty of space on disk and the bandwidth available or youâ€™ll end 
  up dropping a lot of frames and the files will be useless.

I changed lots of things but I will try to list some of my most important changes.
The MFC Recorder now captures the MFC stream in standard FLV quality, as if it was recorded eg with rtmpdump. 
That's why I think that only one directory is enough where all the files are recorded and in most cases don't need a conversion.
By pressing the model name you get a preview of the current model in the room. You can refresh this page later if you are interested in a new situation.
If the model is called 'no mobile feed' then you will get a link that you can copy and start in a new page of your browser and see what's happening in the room. Unfortunately, you can not record this unit with this recorder, but by pressing 'state / online' you can get the stream of that model in your browser.
I added in `config.yml` the option to edit the date format for the recorded file.

For advanced users
===========
There are several special URLs that allow implementing some operations with a model even if she is offline.

__Include__

```
http://localhost:9080/models/include?nm=modelname
http://localhost:9080/models/include?uid=12345678
```

__Exclude__

```
http://localhost:9080/models/exclude?nm=modelname
http://localhost:9080/models/exclude?uid=12345678
```

__Delete__

```
http://localhost:9080/models/delete?nm=modelname
http://localhost:9080/models/delete?uid=12345678
```
